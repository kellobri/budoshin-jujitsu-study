# Mastery: The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment / George Leonard

### Mastery - Life Long Learning

Isn't just about reaching goals, internalize philosophy that will keep you learning after the goals.

Rethink your motivations for learning a new skill

- Recognition and gratification
- Stuck in a comfort zone
- Push forward for the sake of it, rather than chase praise and encouragment

Cultivate respect for the process of learning
Mastery is built on long periods of practice without tangible results
Plateaus can be hard to bear

**Dabblers** Drop out when a plateau hits
**Obsessives** Determined to master as quickly as possible, get discouraged
**Hackers** Comfortable on the plateau, aren't motivated enough to improve

Finding great instruction is a must

Surrender - Demands of discipline, sacrifice
Intentionality - Visualize yourself succeeding 
Edge Control - Confronted with a challenge

Surround yourself with other masters, focus on the joy of practice and create rituals to bounce back from pitfalls
